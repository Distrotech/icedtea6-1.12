CVE-XXXX-YYYY: http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=XXXX-YYYY

New in release 1.11 (2011-XX-XX):

* Use HotSpot 20 as the default virtual machine.
* Added JamVM support for mips and mips64.
* Bug fixes
  - PR637: make check should exit with an error code if any of regression test
    failed. Use make check -k if you want to run all three test suites. And it
    is now also possible to run individual jtreg testsuite (jdk,langtools and
    hotspot) with the jtreg_checks argument:
    make check jtreg_checks="langtools hotspot".
    If none is provided make check runs all testsuites.
  - CACAO PR157: ARM SMP Assertion thinlock failed.
* Backports
  - S7023591, S7027667: Clipped antialiased rectangles are filled, not drawn.

New in release 1.10 (2011-XX-XX):

* NetX and the plugin moved to the IcedTea-Web project with a separate
  release cycle.
* Shark provided upstream rather than as part of IcedTea.
* The option --with-openjdk becomes --with-jdk-home and --disable-bootstrap
* Support for building with HotSpot 20 from its stable tree
* Added out-of-the-box JamVM support using --enable-jamvm.
* Allow building of JamVM beside the default VM by using --with-additional-vms=jamvm
* Allow the location of the JamVM source zip to be specified using --with-jamvm-src-zip
* Import of OpenJDK6 b21 including upgrade to HotSpot 19

Zero/Shark
- Formatting changes and other fixes to match upstream
- PR428: Shark on ARM precompiled header incls
- Update Shark for LLVM r95390 API change.

  packed into given handle. This increases stability and breaks
  reliance on the assumption that the browser will always provide a
  handle in a certain sequence.

  before sending them to Java side (de-coding code is already in
  effect on Java side).

  enough time to load.
- Fix security permissions related to get/set property, based on
  specifications.

New in release 1.7 (2010-01-27):

  by Firefox >= 3.6), the new plugin is required and the build will
  automatically enable it if the old plugin is requested.
- Support added for building with HotSpot 16 using
  --with-hotspot-build=hs16.  This is the same as was released
  in the proprietary JDK6 update 18.
- Zero port updated to match the version submitted to OpenJDK
  as closely as possible.
- libjpeg7, libjpeg8, libpng 1.4 and libXext >= 1.1.0 supported.

  documentation of the various trace points and arguments available.
- Allow building of other virtual machines besides the default VM. Additional
  virtual machines on architectures where hotspot is available are cacao
  and zero (or shark), and cacao, where zero (or shark) is available. It's
  not possible to build cacao as the default VM, and zero as additional VM.

  pre-alpha technology preview and not recommended for use.
- Better support for bootstrapping with different jar programs
  (supporting -J options).
- If --with-pkgversion isn't given the short mercurial rev node version
  will be used.  Package distributors are encouraged to build packages with
  --with-pkgversion to uniquely identify their distribution version number
  when java -version is run to help distribution specific bug reporting.

  to fix visual anomalies.
